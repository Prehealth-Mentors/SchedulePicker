# Description: This file prevents uploading testing files with data to version control
#  except for the ones defined in the sampledata folder. While the .gitignore defines
#  rules to prevent testing files from being staged to the commit. This pre-commit script
#  makes sure to prevent any testing files from making it into version control on accident
